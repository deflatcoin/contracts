DEFLAT Coin

A total of 1,000,000,000 coins will be made available over time, 99.9% will be placed on the market through purchase by real interested, this condition is guaranteed in ethereum contracts, without the possibility of dump by the developers. The other 0.1% of the coins were destined for the first operations in the mainnet, even so it is a very small amount in relation to the total volume.

At the present time of the 0.1% only 26,000 units are still in circulation, for initial supply of the exchanges (construction of pairs). The surplus of coins, due to the phase of implantation, are gadaalmente being moved to a special contract (Frozen Forever), whose balance can be tracked, aiming at a low initial supply of currencies.

Another feature is that the price at the source (sale contract) to be always increasing in proportion to the amount of coins in circulation, the more coins circulating the more expensive will be putting a new currency in the market. avoiding that the contract of sale as a dump source. Changing from the point of view, less currency at its source more expensive it will be, avoiding the free increase of the money supply in circulation.

As explained above no currency is put into circulation without a financial burden on ethereum, allowing a substantial bid in volume and price, which consequently gives a good liquidity to the asset.
